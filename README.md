# I. Configure Blender 2.79 for Indiana Jones and the Infernale Machine 3D modelling.

Note: This Blender add-on is partially complete and functional (faces and lightning properties menu are missing due to lack of UI support in Blender, it must be writed in the .3do file with text editor), but you can create/modify any model and import it into the game.

1. Download the add-on and follow installation instructions at:
https://github.com/smlu/blender-ijim

2. You are now able to mod the .3do files.

# II. Use script to create sector of levels.



# End
